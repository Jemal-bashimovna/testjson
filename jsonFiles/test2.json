Johanna, hostile to a world she’s never experienced, is being returned to her biological aunt and uncle against her will. \n\nKidd agrees to deliver the child where the law says she belongs. As they travel hundreds of miles into the unforgiving wilderness, the two will face tremendous challenges of both human and natural forces as they search for a place that either can call home.\n\nNews of the World is directed by Greengrass (the Bourne films, United 93) from his screenplay with Luke Davies (Lion), based on the National Book Award finalist and best-selling novel by Paulette Jiles. The film is produced by Gary Goetzman (Mamma Mia! franchise, Greyhound), Gail Mutrux (The Danish Girl, Donnie Brasco) and Gregory Goodman (22 July, 8 Mile). The executive producers are Steven Shareshian and Tore Schmidt. The film’s music is by eight-time Academy Award® nominee James Newton Howard. \n\nSocial Channels: \n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/NewsOfTheWorld\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/newsoftheworld\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/newsoftheworldmovie\nSite: www.NewsOfTheWorldFilm.com",
